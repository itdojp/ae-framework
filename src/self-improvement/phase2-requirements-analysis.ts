# TypeScript Error Resolution Requirements

The system must resolve 278 identified TypeScript compilation errors through systematic analysis and type-safe solutions.

## Functional Requirements
- The system shall identify and categorize all TypeScript compilation errors by type and severity
- The system must implement type-safe solutions that maintain existing functionality
- The system shall preserve all existing interfaces and public APIs during error resolution

- The system shall implement proper type guards and assertions where needed
- The system must resolve import/export type compatibility issues
- The system shall fix interface property mismatches and missing properties
- The system must handle generic type constraints and variance correctly

## Non-Functional Requirements  
- Error resolution must not degrade runtime performance by more than 5%
- The system should maintain backward compatibility with existing consumers
- Type fixes must be comprehensible and maintainable by future developers
- The system should use TypeScript best practices and avoid "any" type usage
- Error resolution should be completed in systematic phases to enable progress tracking

## Business Requirements
- TypeScript errors must be resolved to enable reliable automated builds
- The framework must maintain type safety to prevent runtime errors in production
- Development productivity must be improved through better IDE support and autocomplete
- The system must support continuous integration workflows without type errors

## Technical Requirements
- All fixes must pass existing test suites without modification
- The system must use TypeScript 5.x compatible syntax and features
- Interface definitions must be consistent across the entire codebase
- Generic type parameters must be properly constrained and bounded
- The system must handle Buffer, Promise, and complex object types correctly
