- 💡 Create proper ignore files to prevent sensitive data exposure
- 💡 Use cryptographically secure random number generators
- 💡 Avoid eval() and similar functions, use safer alternatives
- 💡 Use well-established cryptographic libraries and standards
- 💡 Implement static code analysis tools in CI/CD pipeline
- 💡 Conduct regular security code reviews
- 💡 Implement automated security testing in CI/CD
- 💡 Regular code reviews with security focus

## Next Steps
