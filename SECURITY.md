# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Currently supported versions for security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | ✅ Yes             |
| < 1.0   | ❌ No              |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do NOT create a public GitHub issue

Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to avoid exposing the issue before a fix is available.

### 2. Contact us directly

- **Email**: security@ae-framework.dev (preferred)
- **GitHub Security Advisory**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature

### 3. Include detailed information

Please provide:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if you have one)
- Your contact information

### 4. Response timeline

- **Initial response**: Within 24 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Fix timeline**: Depends on severity
  - Critical: 1-7 days
  - High: 1-14 days
  - Medium: 1-30 days
  - Low: Next scheduled release

## Security Measures

### Automated Security Scanning

- **Dependency scanning**: `npm audit` runs on every CI build
- **Secret detection**: Gitleaks scans for exposed credentials
- **Code analysis**: CodeQL security analysis (when available)
- **Container scanning**: Docker images scanned for vulnerabilities

### Development Practices

- All dependencies are regularly updated
- Security linting rules are enforced
- Code review required for all changes
- Principle of least privilege applied
- Input validation and sanitization implemented

### Infrastructure Security

- All communications use HTTPS/TLS
- Environment variables for sensitive configuration
- No hardcoded credentials in source code
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

## Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization

- Token-based authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Session management with secure defaults
- API rate limiting implemented

### Data Protection

- Encryption at rest and in transit
- PII data handling compliance
- Secure backup procedures
- Data retention policies enforced

### Monitoring & Logging

- Security event logging
- Anomaly detection
- Incident response procedures
- Regular security metrics review

## Vulnerability Disclosure

### Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. Report received and acknowledged
2. Vulnerability confirmed and assessed
3. Fix developed and tested
4. Security advisory published
5. CVE assigned (if applicable)
6. Recognition provided to reporter

### Bug Bounty

We currently do not have a formal bug bounty program, but we recognize and appreciate security researchers who help improve our security posture.

## Security Tools

### Required Tools

- `npm audit` - Dependency vulnerability scanning
- `gitleaks` - Secret detection
- ESLint security rules
- GitHub Security Advisories

### Recommended Tools

- CodeQL - Static analysis security testing
