# LLM First-Pass Review Checklist

Purpose: Provide a consistent, human-approved checklist for the first-pass review of AI-assisted changes before merge.

Scope:
- Use this when an LLM/agent produced code, tests, or documentation.
- This does not replace human review; it standardizes it.

## Required inputs
- Spec or Blueprint (if present): `docs/templates/spec-kit/` or `docs/templates/blueprint/`
- Context Bundle (if used): `docs/guides/context-bundle.md`
- Context Vacuum checklist: `docs/guides/context-vacuum-checklist.md`
- Verification summary: `docs/quality/pr-summary-template.md`
- Gates guide: `docs/quality/verification-gates.md`

## Checklist

### 1) Intent and scope
- The PR summary matches the actual diff scope (no hidden changes).
- The change aligns with Spec/Blueprint, or a short rationale explains deviations.
- Any new behavior has explicit acceptance criteria.

### 2) Evidence and verification
- Required CI checks are green (Verify Lite at minimum).
- Optional gates are enabled when risk is high (mutation, contract, MBT, perf/a11y/lh).
- Report artifacts are linked or summarized in the PR.

### 3) Risk and safety
- No security-sensitive change is made without explicit review notes.
- External API changes have contract or compatibility evidence.
- Performance regressions are ruled out or explicitly accepted.

### 4) Machine-verifying-machine guard
- Tests were not generated by the same model without human review.
- For critical logic, at least one independent check exists (manual reasoning, separate tool, or targeted test).

### 5) Rollback and ownership
- Rollback path is documented for behavior changes.
- Ownership is clear (who to contact if this breaks).
