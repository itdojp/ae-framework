## 🔧 Technical Implementation Highlights

### Unified Agent Architecture
```typescript
// Domain-driven agent system with unified processing
export class UnifiedAgent {
  async processTask(task: AgentTask): Promise<TaskResult> {
    // Unified task processing for all agent types
  }
}
```

### Optimized Service Layer
```typescript
// Performance-optimized service management
export class UnifiedServiceManager {
  async executeTask(task: ServiceTask): Promise<ServiceResult> {
    // Optimized execution with caching and pooling
  }
}
```
