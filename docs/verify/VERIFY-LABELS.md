# Verify Labels: Optional Enforcement Toggles

This repository supports opt‑in enforcement via PR labels. By default, all checks are report‑only.

- `enforce-contracts`
  - Fails the PR when runtime contracts execution reports any failure (parseIn/pre/post/parseOut).
  - Equivalent to setting `CONTRACTS_ENFORCE=1` in CI environment.

- `enforce-formal`
  - Fails the PR when model checking finds any failing TLC module or Alloy spec.
  - Reads `artifacts/codex/model-check.json` generated by `scripts/verify/run-model-checks.mjs`.

Notes
- Use these labels only on PRs where you want stricter gating; otherwise, the pipeline remains report‑only for fast feedback.
- You can remove the labels to return to report‑only behavior on subsequent pushes.
