# Adapter CI Examples

This note consolidates adapter-related CI snippets and where to place artifacts.

- Upload  for adapters to be summarized in PR comments.
- Keep XML/JUnit raw files as artifacts, but aggregate from JSON.
- See: docs/templates/ci/testing-ddd-scripts.snippet.yml

Minimal snippet:

```yaml
name: adapters-quick
on: [pull_request]

  adapters:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
